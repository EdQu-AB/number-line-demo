# Usage instructions

* The app should work out of the box by opening the index.html file in a web browser
* The (currently) used frontend libraries are also inlined into the git reposity in order to simplify setup
* A package.json for npm is included (currently only set to install bower) - feel free to add additional tools as needed. Use `npm install` to install any such library into `node_modules` (e.g. if you don't have bower installed already)
* A bower.json is included for specifying third party frontend libraries (currently angular and d3) - feel free to add more as needed. Running `bower install` (re-)installs libraries into the bower_components dir
